# Camera TF Note

Camera links and joints are hardcoded into the urdf due to an issue with the realsense package publishing TF. The offsets for each individual camera are unique and hardcoded in.

For reference, serial number to camera number is:

Camera1 - 2511003020

Camera2 - 2511004212

Camera3 - 2511011555

Camera4 - 3511803513
